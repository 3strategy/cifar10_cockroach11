# cifar10_cockroach11
a modified cifar10 database with added cockroaches as the 11th class, along with training of the new dataset with some transfer learning.

Most learning will be done on a colab file that will be linked here. 
## The git's purpose is to contain the code that runs locally for the data preparation and to hold the final dataset that will be generated.
